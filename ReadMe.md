# homework1: Code Refactor

```
Refactored the code of an existing webpage so that it follows accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines.
```

## Changes made to code

```
1. Updated the title of the webpage from "website" to "Horiseon"
2. Added "search-engine-optimization" ID to Search Engine Optimization div section so the href link at the top of the page works
3. Added alt descriptor to images
4. Updated div tags to make them semantic:
    <header></header>
    <section></section>
    <aside></aside>
    <footer></footer>
5. In the stlye.css sheet, combined classes used in aside elements (i.e., "benefit-lead", "benefit-brand", etc.) to a single class and renamed it to "benefit-section" & updated html file to account for the name changes
6. In the stlye.css sheet, combined classes used in section elements (i.e., "search-engine-optimization", "online-reputation-management", etc.) to a single class and renamed it to "search-reputation-social" & updated html file to account for the name changes
7. Added title to div element with background image - this is to serve as the alt text for the image
8. Removed </img> from self-closing image element under Cost Management
